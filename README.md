# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
# Description:
The Delivery Time Prediction project focuses on predicting the delivery time for food or package deliveries using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a regression model that takes various factors into account, such as delivery person information, restaurant and delivery location coordinates, distance, order type, vehicle type, and other relevant features, to estimate the time it would take for the delivery to reach the customer.

The project utilizes a decision tree regression algorithm to train the model. It includes data preprocessing steps, such as feature scaling, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like R-squared score at value 1.0 and mean squared error at 0.0.

The provided code snippets demonstrate how to fit the decision tree regressor model, make predictions, and calculate evaluation metrics. Additionally, a sample dataset is used to showcase the process of predicting delivery time for a specific case.

This project can be helpful for delivery service providers and logistics companies seeking to optimize their operations and improve delivery time estimations.
